                    <h3>Monkey</h3>
                    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most simian mammals of infraorder Simiiformes. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes; in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes may also be included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of their scope. Monkeys are divided into the families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys (which again include apes in the broader sense as parvorder Catarrhini, but not in the stricter sense as family Cercopithecidae). </p><P>Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.</P>
